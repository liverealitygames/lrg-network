          <p>You are encouraged to learn from what has come before you! Watch other LRGs on youtube and browse their social media to get your ideas! Of course, there are some very impressive, large, wooden challenges set up by some games, but it's ok to start smaller, especially in your first season.</p>

          <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Other Tips</h3>
          <p>It is always recommended (and fun!) to try the challenges out before the day of the game. Gather your "Dream Team", to test the challenges to make sure they aren't too hard or too easy. You will want to estimate how long challenges will take by having people test them. Through a dream team, you can also troubleshoot, anticipate what questions players may have, and firm up the rules to each challenge. Players will always want to see how they can push the limits of a challenge, so a strong challenge team will have clarity beforehand about what is and is not going to be acceptable.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <p>It's recommended to have an extra challenge or two ready to go in case something breaks or changes on game day.</p>
          <p>You will also want to make sure your challenges are designed so anyone can participate and you have the right balance between physical, mental and social for your particular game. (If you have a food challenge, make sure you've accounted for dietary restrictions. If you have players who can't swim, make sure only some of the players need to do a swimming portion of the challenge.)</p>
