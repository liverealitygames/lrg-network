          <p class="lead">Whether you are planning to cast only friends and family or open your game to the world, you’ll want a place to share pictures and videos from your game. Having an active social media presence helps get the word out about your game and also builds community after the game is over. Creating an Instagram account and/or a Facebook group is easy and free!</p>
          <p>Remember, social media is very focused on visual impact, so make sure you are taking lots of pictures and video clips during your game!</p>

          <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Tips for Instagram</h3>
          <p>Instagram often limits accounts when they are brand new to prevent spamming and bots. In the first few days when you have an account, it may limit the number of people you can follow or message. If this happens to you, don’t panic — be patient and it will work itself out.</p>
          <p>Once you’ve created your account, you’ll want to follow other Live Reality Games and players, especially games in your geographic area. Instagram is nice for outreach because you can follow players that are tagged in other games or follow people who follow similar games to yours — essentially, letting them see that you exist! You can also message LRGs that are close to you and see if they can help spread the word and just say hello! You never know where that networking can lead!</p>
          <p>When you are thinking about casting, make sure to reach out to <a href="https://instagram.com/LRG_casting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@LRG_casting</a> on Instagram. You can tag that account on your early posts so the posts can be easily shared.</p>

          </div>

          <p>When you make a big announcement and want other organizers and people/accounts involved to also share on their main page, you can make a post and add “collaborators” — if that account accepts the collaboration, the post will show on both your main feed and also theirs. For example, if you make a casting announcement and include the @LRG_casting account as a collaborator, the announcement will show up for everyone who follows you or that account.</p>
          <p>If you plan to livestream on Instagram, you need to have at least 1000 followers. Work on building your base before the game. If you are a new game, you might not post “live”, but just post updates throughout the game. The restrictions for livestreaming can change over time, so research before the game!</p>
          <p>After the game, encourage your cast and crew to post about their experience and tag your game. If you are airing episodes, this is extra important to help spread premiere news and to just build the excitement!</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Never used Instagram?</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">The essential things to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can post to your main feed, which stays there for people to see anytime they come to your profile. You can also post a “Story” and that goes away after 24 hours.</li>
              <li>For an LRG, you’ll generally want your profile to be public so people can freely share your main feed posts.</li>
              <li>If you make a story, you should tag any people or other accounts you’d want to be able to re-share on their story.</li>
              <li>Sharing links is kind of annoying on Instagram, but it can be done two ways. You can put links in your BIO on your main profile page. You can also put a link in your story, using the link feature when you are creating the story. Unfortunately, putting a link in a main feed post doesn’t generally work (you can list a website, but the link itself won’t function as a link).</li>
              <li>You can create a “highlight” on your profile that is essentially an archive of chosen story posts. Some games may have a highlight section for each season of their game. Look around at how accounts use the highlights to give you ideas of how you’d like to use them!</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Tips for Facebook</h3>
          <p>Most games create a Facebook page as a way to disseminate information, including casting information, livestreams, and episodes.</p>
          <!-- Image 3: R (one paragraph into section) -->
          <div class="resource-image-wrapper float-lg-end mb-4 mb-lg-3">

            <p class="resource-image-caption">Photo: Olympia — Candid cast moment</p>
          </div>
          <p>After the game is over, most games will create a cast or cast/crew Facebook Messenger chat to help stay connected after the game. Alternatively, some games create a Facebook group just for the game’s players and production (a private “alumni” group).</p>
          <p>When you are thinking about casting, make sure to cross-post on the Live Reality Games page on Facebook. This is a public page that many games use to advertise their game. There is also a Live Reality Games casting page, but that is less frequently trafficked.</p>
          <p>Facebook allows a game to livestream their season to the public, which can be a great way for friends and family to watch and support players without needing episodes to be made. It is important to note that Facebook does not retain this video footage forever, and therefore should be downloaded after a season airs if you want to do anything else with it.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Tips for TikTok</h3>
            <p><strong>Post frequently (but with caution).</strong> TikTok thrives on short-form content. Instead of posting one 10-minute competition, try sharing 4–5 standout moments from that competition. Just be careful not to spam your videos. Space them out by about 30 minutes.</p>
            <!-- Image 4: L (one paragraph into section) -->
            <div class="resource-image-wrapper float-lg-start mb-4 mb-lg-3">

              <p class="resource-image-caption">Photo: City Quest NYC — Participants working together</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Utilize ALL of TikTok’s features.</strong> Whether it’s music, hashtags, location tags, or whatever the newest trend is, TikTok rewards creators who use its tools. For example, tagging your city can help local people discover your event. And yes, it actually works!</p>
            <p><strong>Be messy.</strong> TikTok loves chaos. Not every video needs to be perfectly polished. That’s part of the platform’s charm! Embrace goofs, gaffes, behind-the-scenes moments, bloopers, and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Be present.</strong> Engage with your comments. Answer questions, share info, and be funny! TikTok has a great sense of humor, and being able to banter with your audience makes the experience more enjoyable for everyone. (Pro tip: replying to comments with videos is always a win!)</p>
            <p><strong>Be unique.</strong> What we do is already incredibly niche so lean into that! Most people who come across your videos will have never heard of LRGs. While it may feel routine to us, it’s a whole new world for them. Show it off!</p>
            <p><strong>Expand your casting demographics.</strong> If you’re looking for younger or more targeted demographics, TikTok is a great way to reach new audiences and recruit new LRG players. Algorithms are helpful to finding a targeted demographic to cast.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <p>Whether you focus on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or a mix of all three, the key is to capture and share the energy of your game. Photos and clips from challenges, tribal councils, cast hangouts, and behind-the-scenes moments all help attract new players and keep your community connected long after the season ends.</p>
