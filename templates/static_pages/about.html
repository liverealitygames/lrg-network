  <h2>What are Live Reality Games?</h2>
  <p>Live Reality Games (LRGs) are events where a group of strangers come together to challenge themselves socially, physically, and strategically, have fun, and fight to be the last player standing. The majority of LRGs are inspired by popular reality television shows, but games often add their own unique twists or challenges. Overall, these are fan-created games made by fans for fans to have adventure, build a community, and win bragging rights.</p>
  <p>LRGs range greatly in production, length, and style. For example, games range in size, from smaller games in backyards and local parks with friends and family to larger games with a formal casting process that bring together people from far away. Games may run anywhere from one day to a full week. There are college clubs that run games that last an entire semester. Certain games even have a giving component, with players fundraising and competing for money to be donated to chosen non-profits or causes. Finally, while some games are unrecorded, other games are streamed live on various social media platforms for friends and family to watch or even uploaded as edited episodes on YouTube.</p>
  <p>Some of the most well-known LRGs draw inspiration from hit reality TV shows. For example, games based on <strong>Survivor</strong> have contestants outwit, outplay, and outlast each other in a battle for survival, all while being outdoors and exposed to the elements. Games based on <strong>Big Brother</strong> similarly have players navigate social dynamics and form alliances, but inside of a house. Other games take inspiration from <strong>The Mole</strong> or <strong>The Traitors</strong>, where players compete in challenges and must discern social dynamics to determine who can or cannot be trusted. Finally, there are LRGs that take the best elements of these well-known shows to create unique and original formats.</p>
