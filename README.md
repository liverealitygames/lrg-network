#
# POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
# DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
#
# If you're missing these values, contact a project maintainer.

# Build and start the app
docker compose up --build
```

Then open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) in your browser.
